For additional documentation please see the cryogen site.FeaturesPrerequisitesYou will need Leiningen 2.5.0 or above installed.UsageCreating a New SiteA new site can be created using the Cryogen template as follows:Running the ServerThe web server can be started from the my-blog directory using the lein-ring plugin:The server will watch for changes in the content and themes folders and recompile the content automatically.You can also generate the content without bringing up a server via:Site ConfigurationThe site configuration file is found at content/config.edn, this file looks as follows:For information about each key please see the "Configuration" portion of the Cryogen documentation site.Switching between Markdown and AsciiDocCryogen comes with Markdown support as default. If you want to use AsciiDoc instead, open the project.clj in your created blog (e.g. my-blog), and change the line in :dependencies that says cryogen-markdown to cryogen-asciidoc. Instead of looking for files ending in .md in the content/md directory, the compiler will now look for files ending in .asc in the content/asc directory.Selecting a ThemeThe Cryogen template comes with three themes in the themes folder. To change your blog's theme, change the value of the :theme key in config.edn. Note that the Nucleus theme is obtained from downloadwebsitetemplates.co.uk that requires you to keep the footer, unless you make a donation on their website.Customizing LayoutsCryogen uses Selmer templating engine for layouts. Please refer to its documentation to see the supported tags and filters for the layouts.The layouts are contained in the themes/{theme}/html folder of the project. By default, the base.html layout is used to provide the general layout for the site. This is where you would add static resources such as CSS and JavaScript assets as well as define headers and footers for your site.Each page layout should have a name that matches the :layout key in the page metadata and end with .html. Page layouts extend the base layout and should only contain the content relaveant to the page inside the content block. For example, the tag layout is located in tag.html and looks as follows:Code Syntax HighlightingCryogen uses Highlight.js for code syntax highlighting. You can add more languages by replacing themes/{theme}/js/highlight.pack.js with a customized package from here.The  initHighlightingOnLoad function is called in themes/{theme}/html/base.html.Deploying Your SiteThe generated static content will be found under the public folder. Simply copy the content to a static folder for a server such as Nginx or Apache and your site is now ready for service.A sample Nginx configuration that's placed in /etc/nginx/sites-available/default can be seen below:Simply set yoursite.com to the domain of your site in the above configuration and ensure the static content is available at /var/blog/. Finally, place your custom error page in the /var/blog/404.html file.More information on deployment can be found here.Third Party Librarieshttps://github.com/greywolve/cryogen-markdown-externalA Clojure library to provide Markdown rendering to the cryogen-core compiler by using an external command/program, such as pandoc.Some Sites Made With Cryogen</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
